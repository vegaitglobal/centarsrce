# centarsrce

Mobile application for the suicide prevention Centar Srce (https://www.centarsrce.org/).

The idea is to create a free suicide prevention app. The app is intended to help people to overcome emotional crises and suicidal tendencies. Also, the app would teach its users how to help others who may be thinking about committing suicide how to reach out to them proactively and how to contribute to destigmatization of suicide. One part of the app would be educational. Most importantly, it would also be connected with the suicide prevention lifeline and emergency services so they can reach support easily and quickly.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
